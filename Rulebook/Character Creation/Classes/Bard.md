There are  musicians in the world that can influence nations. These men and women are the ones that write the histories of the people of the world of Tower.

They can be warriors, welding sound as a weapon. They can be the dreams of happiness  or the nightmare that weakens you.

Their magic is centered  around the mind and sound.
