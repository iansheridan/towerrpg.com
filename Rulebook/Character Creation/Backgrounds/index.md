# Character Backgrounds

A characters background can be extremely important for the development of our character. This defines your bases for what templates that your character will have access too. Are you a farmhand from a remote village? did you grow up in a grand city attending the Mage academy? Or an urchin on the streets?

A background will not have powers. They will only have base skills. A background is supposed to provide the character the basic skills and contacts to the character. No power.

## Backgrounds

- [[Farmhand]]
- [[Street Urchin]]
