# Steps of combat
#rules 

## Combat is made up of these elements:

- Mortality points (MP)
	- _Everyone_ has just **one**
- [[combat declarations|Declarations]]
	- the player tells the group (GM and Players) what **actions** they are going to take during this round. Circumstances will alter these actions as things happen durning each Round.
- [[Speed]] 
	- this regulates who goes first and how many actions that a combatant can take.
- [[Movement]]
	- Movement is the amount of steps that you have to move your character around the space you are fighting in.
	- During The player's turn they can move before or after any action they take as long as they have movement left.
	- Movement is not considered an action.

## Steps of combat

1. GM **[[Declaration]]** 
	- declares what is going on by describing the scene.
2. Players **[[Declaration]]**
	- declare what they are doing with their Actions
	- it is encouraged that all the players coordinate if possible
3. All combatants Roll as many six sided dices as they have **Speed**.
	- ex. with a 3 speed you  roll this:
	  `dice: 3d6|norender`
	- the highest roll goes first 
	- a tie is decided in this order;
		- Players before non-player-characters
		- Player vs. Player: Roll speed and highest goes first.
4. [[Take Action]]!
	- Player  Turn
		- On your turn you take as many actions as you have speed points.
