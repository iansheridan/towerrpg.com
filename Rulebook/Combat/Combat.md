# Combat

#rules #wip 

## Combat is Lethal

Combat is more lethal in TowerRPG than many role playing games. Every living thing  only has one [[Mortality Point]]. Every deadly weapon does one or more [[Mortality Point]]s in damage.

So, it is very important for your character to be able to protect themselves. This is done by wearing armor or equipping and using any thing that blocks damage. Like the weapons that you have.

## Taking Damage 

Getting hit with a deadly weapon will kill a character in one hit. This can be mitigated by armor or magic but there is no half measures. If you are hit you are stunned and out of combat. If you were hit with 6 or more [[Mortality Point]]s in a single turn you *die instantly*.

All is not lost but you can still be healed but you are have as many rounds as your  CON Bonus +1 until death.
