# Take Action

So you are ready to have your character to take action. The system uses a d6 to determine a random number that helps you ascertain wether or not your character has accomplished an action you have set them to do.

## Action

An action is either a task or attack. Say you want your character to cook a meal you would either use your [[Survival]] skill or your [[cooking]] skill, which is a sub-skill of the [[Survival]]. You would then roll as many six-sided dice as your character has ranks in [[cooking]], ranks in [[Survival]], and the bonus of the attribute associated with the [[cooking]] skill.

ex.

- 1d6 from [[cooking]]
- 3d6 from [[Survival]]
- 2d6 from wizdom bonus
- for a total of **6 dice**

### Rolling The Dice

Now that we have the number of dice we need to roll to cook that meal. What we need is the difficulty and the roll result to determin a success. The GM says that this meal average difficulty so assigns a 3. So now you roll the 6 six-sided dice and you get the following:

The result is a **_success_** of **1**, but not a critical success. The dice rolled need to be greater than the difficulty of 3 to become a success. Here is an example of a critical success.

6d6>3 -> [2, 3, 6*, 5*, 6*, 6*]>3 -> **4**

WooHoo! a success of **4**! That is a critical. the number of successes was more then the difficulty (3) of the roll (\[2, 3, 6*, 5*, 6*, 6*\]->**4**).

Your character has cooked a so good that everyone who eats it gets a buff to be determined by the GM.

## Contested Actions

### What are _Contested Actions_?

Contested actions are the actions that you are taking that are able to be resisted by the target of said action.

### Judging of Contested Actions

The base difficulty of a Contested Action is 4. The GM can adjust that if they deem it necessary.

With the difficulty of 4 set, both beings participating in the action roll the skill. If they succeed they can eliminate their opponents successes with as many sixes they have rolled. Only if their opponent has rolled any one's and then only as many one's their opponent has rolled.

ex.
John's roll
6d6>=4 -> [1, 6*, 6*, 1, 1, 5*]>=4 -> **3**
he has 2 sixes and 3 ones.
Tom's roll
7d6>=4 -> [3, 3, 3, 6*, 2, 6*, 4*]>=4 -> **3**
he has 2 sixes and 0 ones.

John cannot affect Tom's successes. Tom **can** reduce John's number of successes by _2_. So, Tom _wins_ the contested action.
