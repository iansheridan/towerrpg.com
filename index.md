## These are the rules for TowerRPG

- what is an TTRPG?
  - A **tabletop role-playing game** (typically abbreviated as **TRPG** or **TTRPG**), also known as a **pen-and-paper role-playing game**, is a classification for a [role-playing game](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game "Role-playing game") (RPG) in which the participants describe their characters' actions through speech. Participants determine the actions of their characters based on their [characterization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Characterization "Characterization") and the actions succeed or fail according to a set [formal system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Role-playing_game_system "Role-playing game system") of rules and guidelines. Within the rules, players have the freedom to [improvise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Improvisation "Improvisation"); their choices shape the direction and outcome of the game.
- Why did I make TowerRPG?
